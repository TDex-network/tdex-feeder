# tdex-feeder

Feeder allows to connect an external price feed to the TDex Daemon to determine the current market price

## Overview

tdex-feeder connects to exchanges and retrieves market prices in order to consume the gRPC 
interface exposed from tdex-deamon `UpdateMarketPrice`.

3. Give executable permissions. (eg. `chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/feederd`)

### Run
```sh
# Run with default config and default flags.
$ feederd

# Run with debug mode on.
$ feederd -debug

# Run with debug mode and different config path.
