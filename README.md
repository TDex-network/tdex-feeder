# tdex-feeder

Feeder allows to connect several price feeds to TDex Daemon(s) in order to automatically update the markets prices.

## Overview

tdex-feeder connects to exchanges and retrieves market prices in order to consume the gRPC 
interface exposed from tdex-deamon `UpdateMarketPrice`.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Run  Standalone

### Install

1. [Download the latest release for MacOS or Linux](https://github.com/tdex-network/tdex-feeder/releases)

2. Move the feeder into a folder in your PATH (eg. `/usr/local/bin`) and rename the feeder as `feederd`

3. Give executable permissions. (eg. `chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/feederd`)

4. Create [config.json](#config-file) file.

### Run
```sh
# Run with default config and default flags.
$ feederd

# Run with debug mode and different config path.
$ TDEX_FEEDER_CONFIG_PATH=./config.json feederd 
```

## üñ• Local Development

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### Build and Run with docker

#### Build feederd docker image

At the root of the repository
```
docker build -t tdex-feederd .
```

#### Run the daemon

Create a [config.json](#config-file) file 
and run the following command in the same folder:
```
docker run -it -d --net=host -v $PWD/config.json:/data/config.json tdex-feederd
```
`--net=host` in case you're running tdex-deamon locally

### Build it yourself

Builds feeder as static binary and runs the project with default configuration.

#### Linux

`make build-linux`

#### Mac

`make build-mac`

#### Run Linux

`make run-linux`
